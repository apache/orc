/**
 * An ORCv2 file writer. The file is divided into stripes, which is the natural
 * unit of work when reading. Each stripe is buffered in memory until the
 * memory reaches the stripe size and then it is written out broken down by
 * columns. Each column is written by a TreeWriter that is specific to that
 * type of column. TreeWriters may have children TreeWriters that handle the
 * sub-types. Each of the TreeWriters writes the column's data as a set of
 * streams.
 *
 * This class is unsynchronized like most Stream objects, so from the creation
 * of an OrcFile and all access to a single instance has to be from a single
 * thread.
 *
 * There are no known cases where these happen between different threads today.
 *
 * Caveat: the MemoryManager is created during WriterOptions create, that has
 * to be confined to a single thread as well.
