 * Implements a memory manager that keeps a global context of how many ORC
 * writers there are and manages the memory between them. For use cases with

 * By managing the size of each allocation, we try to cut down the size of each
 * allocation and keep the task from running out of memory.
 *
 * This class is not thread safe, but is re-entrant - ensure creation and all
