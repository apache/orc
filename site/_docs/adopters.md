If your company or tool uses ORC, please let us know so that we can update
this page.

### [Apache Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/)

ORC files have always supporting reading and writing from Hadoop's MapReduce,
but with the ORC 1.1.0 release it is now easier than ever without pulling in
Hive's exec jar and all of its dependencies. OrcStruct now also implements
WritableComparable and can be serialized through the MapReduce shuffle.

### [Apache Hive](https://hive.apache.org/)

Apache Hive was the original use case and home for ORC.  ORC's strong
type system, advanced compression, column projection, predicate push
down, and vectorization support make Hive [perform
better](http://hortonworks.com/blog/orcfile-in-hdp-2-better-compression-better-performance/)
than any other format for your data.

### [Apache Nifi](https://nifi.apache.org/)

Apache Nifi is [adding
support](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-1663) for writing
ORC files.

### [Apache Pig](https://pig.apache.org/)

Apache Pig added support for reading and writing ORC files in [Pig
14.0](http://hortonworks.com/blog/announcing-apache-pig-0-14-0/).

### [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/)

Apache Spark has [added
support](http://hortonworks.com/blog/bringing-orc-support-into-apache-spark/)
for reading and writing ORC files with support for column project and
predicate push down.

### [Facebook](https://facebook.com)

With more than 300 PB of data, Facebook was an [early adopter of
ORC](https://code.facebook.com/posts/229861827208629/scaling-the-facebook-data-warehouse-to-300-pb/) and quickly put it into production.

### [Presto](https://prestodb.io/)

The Presto team has done a lot of work [integrating
ORC](https://code.facebook.com/posts/370832626374903/even-faster-data-at-the-speed-of-presto-orc/) into their SQL engine.

### [Vertica](http://www8.hp.com/us/en/software-solutions/advanced-sql-big-data-analytics/)

HPE Vertica has contributed significantly to the ORC C++ library. ORC
is a significant part of Vertica SQL-on-Hadoop (VSQLoH) which brings
the performance, reliability and standards compliance of the Vertica
Analytic Database to the Hadoop ecosystem.
