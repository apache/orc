    HADOOP-19047: S3A: Support in-memory tracking of Magic Commit data (#6468)
    
    
    If the option fs.s3a.committer.magic.track.commits.in.memory.enabled
    is set to true, then rather than save data about in-progress uploads
    to S3, this information is cached in memory.
    
    If the number of files being committed is low, this will save network IO
    in both the generation of .pending and marker files, and in the scanning
    of task attempt directory trees during task commit.
