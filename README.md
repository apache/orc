# [Apache ORC](https://orc.apache.org/)

ORC is a self-describing type-aware columnar file format designed for
Hadoop workloads. It is optimized for large streaming reads, but with
integrated support for finding required rows quickly. Storing data in
a columnar format lets the reader read, decompress, and process only
the values that are required for the current query. Because ORC files
are type-aware, the writer chooses the most appropriate encoding for
the type and builds an internal index as the file is written.
Predicate pushdown uses those indexes to determine which stripes in a
file need to be read for a particular query and the row indexes can
narrow the search to a particular set of 10,000 rows. ORC supports the
complete set of types in Hive, including the complex types: structs,
lists, maps, and unions.

## ORC File C++ Library

This library allows C++ programs to read and write the
_Optimized Row Columnar_ (ORC) file format.
